# spark_dataset_preprocessing
This repository presents a way to prepare datasets to multidimentinal visualization using PySpark.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.7
- Apache Spark 2.6.4 or later
- Pandas
- Scikit learn
- Plotly
- Matplotlib
- Networkx

## Dataset url:
https://bchi.bigcitieshealth.org/indicators/1827/searches/34444

## Run:
- To show the datafame's visualizations until hierarchical visualization of datasets, run: run/vis_main.py
- To see the K-means clustering result separately, run: run/clustering main.py

## Description:
The visualizations shown after executing run/vis_main.py show the process sequence of dataframe preprocessing as well as a simple multi-level visualization of the dataset as a result of the previous tasks.

## To do:
Linking the filters' set with the visualization using Dash so as to simplify interactivity
