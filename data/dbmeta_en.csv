They are never easy to use for modeling and risk analysis. The prediction of global chemical contamination is much delayed compared with the climate change research. It is probably due to the fact that monitoring data as an input of the prediction model and verification material is not prepared. It is a great loss that valuable research results obtained by investing a large amount of research expenses are not fully utilized. In order to make effective use of these valuable information in the future, I think that building a highly versatile database is an essential task. For that reason, we would like to create a database on concentration information on chemical substances in the environment and create a platform (ChemTHEATRE) that stores and view monitoring data on all chemical substances. Utilizing this platform makes it possible to ensure traceability of chemical substances, facilitate prediction of behavior and fate in the environment, and to cooperate with external databases on chemical substance emissions and toxicity information, etc. It ensure ecological risk assessments of highly seasoned chemical substances with high precision and transparency.

",,"Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential ingredient in bakery products. Baker’s yeast is exposed to severe environmental stresses during bread making and the production of commercial yeast products. During bread making, yeast in frozen dough is exposed to freeze-thaw stress, and yeast in high-sugared dough is exposed to high osmolarity. In dried yeast preparation, yeast cells are exposed to air-drying stress.

Figure: https://dbarchive.biosciencedbc.jp/images/dbarchive_images/mail_address/about_eg.jpg

We have investigated the stress tolerance of baker’s yeast by utilizing post-genome research. We collected a wealth of data regarding genes that may be involved in stress tolerance by using two post-genomic approaches, that is, genome-wide gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays (transcriptomics), and genome-wide screening of S. cerevisiae deletion mutant collection (so-called phenomics). We uploaded these data on this website which is designated DGBY(Database for Gene expression and function of Baker's yeast).","This database is applicable to retrieve infomation on gene expression of baker's yeast and growth data of the deletion strain set of S. cerevisiae under baking associated stresses.","""This work was supported by a grant from the Program for Promotion of Basic Research Activities for Innovative Biosciences (PROBRAIN)."",201110030737911494,

Information on those pathways are extracted in the CSML format, one of the XML format, from selected literatures described about the macrophage differentiation and activation (a total of 200 articles).
[Utility and Manner of Utilization]
The CSML format allows users to edit the model and perform simulation of the model by using Cell Illustrator which is one of the softwares for system biology. For experts in macrophage-related areas, it may be useful to search for pathway models related to their work, and also customize the models for further use. They can also take out part of a single pathway for further use or edit and integrate multiple pathways for use as a larger pathway model. Each model is also released in images such as the PNG format.

The solubilities were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography before and after centrifugation.
For aggregation-prone proteins (defined as the proteins with less than 30% solubility in the absence of any chaperone), observations of changes in solubility were made by adding the major chaperones of E. coli, Trigger Factor (TF), DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (KJE) and GroEL/ES (GroE), individually.","Since PURE system is a reconstituted chaperone-free translation system, it is possible to evaluate the solubilities of translated proteins and the chaperone effects accurately.

The object of the project is moving steadily up the layers in the system of life, progressing thus from an understanding of the 'elements' - the transcripts - to an understanding of the 'system' - the transcriptional regulatory network, in other words the 'system' of an individual life form. In FANTOM5, we have systematically investigated exactly what are the sets of genes used in virtually all cell types across the human body, and the genomic regions which determine where the genes are read from. We aim to use this information to build transcriptional regulatory models for every primary cell type that makes up a human. The resource provides raw and processed data obtained in the FANTOM5 project.","The FANTOM5 resources provides a comprehensive map of gene activity across the human body, and provides a holistic view of the complex networks that regulate gene expression across the wide variety of cell types that make up a human being.

As a result, a high-quality large-scale toxicogenomics database with the systems to analyze the gene expression data and predict the safety of candidate chemicals has been developed (TG-GATEs: Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation system）.

Toxicogenomics Informatics Project (TGP2) is TGP's succeeding project, started by the National Institute of Biomedical, the National Institute of Health Sciences, and 13 pharmaceutical companies in 2007. After 5 years of the project, more than 30 safety biomarkers were develped by using TG-GATEs. In addition, data acquired to test biomarkers and analyse their mechanisms are included in TG-GATEs.

The database also contains brief descriptions of individual motifs, literatures with PubMed links, and the corresponding accession numbers in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank.","Background and objectives

A database of nucleotide sequence motifs found in plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (cis-elements) with tools for homology searches will be helpful in estimating the mode of gene regulation, regions involved in such regulation, and other pertinent regions in the DNA sequence. In order to provide a compilation of all reported cis-elements of higher plants, we constructed the PLACE database.

Features and manner

1. The cis-elements in this database including motif sequences, descriptions of major features, and references have been compiled by extensive survey of original literatures. Review articles on the regulatory regions of some plant genes were also used to obtain information on specific groups of motifs.
2. The documents of individual motifs can be accessed by keyword search using a browser.
3. The query sequence is searched by the Signal Scan program. The search can be initiated by copy and paste of the query sequence and the results are shown in a few seconds. The Signal Scan output is shown in one of three options:  a list of motifs in alphabetical order, a sequence map, and a list of motifs beginning at the 5' end of the query sequence.
4. The document contains information on the PubMed ID and the GenBank accession number with corresponding links.

Usefulness

Experimental evidence for each motif is described in the ‘Reference Criteria’ (RC) field. Users of this database must be aware that the motifs compiled here were not strictly examined on this premise. Therefore users are advised to refer to the original reports of individual motifs before using any of the results obtained for publication.","""Development of Advanced Bio-Technology [Next generation recombinant], 1998 (1996-1998)"",,

From 1214 reports, we selected 5096 QTLs. The positions of these QTLs were estimated from the physical positions of either two flanking markers (the genomic positions of the distal ends of the two markers) or a co-segregated single marker (between the start and end positions on the genome). If the QTLs were isolated by map-based cloning, the position of the BAC/PAC clone or gene locus was used. By screening for redundancy of traits at the same physical positions, as of March 31 of 2008, we selected 1051 QTLs extracted from 463 reports as representative QTLs. To arrange QTL information, we constructed QTL database (QTL Annotation Rice Online database; Q-TARO, http://qtaro.abr.affrc.go.jp/) consists of two web interfaces. One interface is a table containing information on the mapping of each QTL and its genetic parameters. The other interface is a genome viewer for viewing genomic locations of the QTLs. Currently, update of QTL information is not continued.","Over the past two decades, genetic dissection of complex phenotypes of economic and biological interest has revealed the chromosomal locations of many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in rice and their contributions to phenotypic variation. Mapping resolution has varied considerably among QTL studies, owing to differences in population size and number of DNA markers used. Additionally, the same QTLs have often been reported with different locus designations. This situation has made it difficult to determine allelic relationships among QTLs and to compare their positions. To facilitate reliable comparisons of rice QTLs, we extracted QTL information from published research papers and constructed a database of 1051 representative QTLs, which we classified into 21 trait categories. Q-TARO clearly displays the co-localization of QTLs and distribution of QTL clusters on the rice genome.","""Integrated Research Project for Plant, Insect and Animal using Genome Technology, QT-1006"",200902278543564818,

Specifically, the existing multiple tRNA gene search programs are used for automatic search of tRNA gene from sequenced prokaryote, eukaryote and virus genomes and envrironmental DNA sequences, and then the experts manually check those cases in which different results are generated by program.","- The database was constructed by performing a comprehensive search of tRNA genes on 1625 full-length genomes and 2993 draft genomes of bacteria and Archaea, 151 complete virus genomes, 121 complete chloroplast genomes, 12 complete eukaryote (Plant and Fungi) genomes and about 230 million environmental DNA sequences.
- Three prediction programs (tRNAScan-SE, Aragorn and tRNA finder) are used together to search tRNA genes. If the prediction results do not match, curation is carried out by experts.
- The relationship between the codon usage frequency and the number of tRNA genes can be browsed for each species to search the codon recognized by major isoaccepting tRNA (optimal codon) or minor tRNA (nonoptimal codon).","""MEXT Integrated Database Project"",201410043352900536,25

Every year more than 100 thousands of people suffer from trypanosomiasis. It also infects livestock, and more than 100 thousands of cattle have died per year. So far, it has been found effective targets for drug development that can control trypanosomiasis. One of such targets is a group of enzymes that control trypanosome DNA/RNA biosynthetic pathway. Another target is a group of enzymes that control trypanosome oxidation/reduction pathway.
